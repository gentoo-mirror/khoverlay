The upstream source repository for khoverlay has moved from Gitlab to
Sourcehut.

No action is required for users that enabled khoverlay via
'eselect repository enable khoverlay'.  If you set up your own
configuration in /etc/portage/repos.conf and are pulling directly from
Gitlab, then please update sync-uri as follows.  On the next sync,
Portage will pull from the new location.

    old) sync-uri = https://gitlab.com/khumba/khoverlay.git

    new) sync-uri = https://git.sr.ht/~khumba/khoverlay

No change is required if you are using the gentoo-mirror copy of the
repository:

    also fine) https://github.com/gentoo-mirror/khoverlay.git
