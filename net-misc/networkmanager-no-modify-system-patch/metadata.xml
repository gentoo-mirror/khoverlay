    READ THIS BEFORE USING THIS PACKAGE.

    Official Gentoo packaging of NetworkManager >=1.42.6 unconditionally
    sets a nondefault build-time option (-Dmodify_system=true) that
    allows ALL logged in users to modify system connections, including
    reading network credentials (https://bugs.gentoo.org/905668).  This
    ebuild provides a patch to the configure script that disables the
    logic behind this option, so that network settings are again
    protected from untrusted users and programs.

    This ebuild is package.masked by default as it has the potential to
    break the build of NetworkManager, especially on ~arch when a new
    version of NetworkManager is released and the patch no longer
    applies cleanly.  My main focus is on keeping a healthy build for
    stable, but pings are welcome if things break on unstable.

    This ebuild will collect patches for multiple versions of
    NetworkManager.  The current latest patch will be placed in the
    unversioned /etc/portage/patches/net-misc/networkmanager directory.
    Patches for versions of NetworkManager older than the latest patch
    will be placed in versioned
    /etc/portage/patches/net-misc/networkmanager-NNN directories.

    After installing this package for the first time, rebuilding
    net-misc/networkmanager is required.
