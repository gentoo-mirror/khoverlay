# Previously magiccube4d-2.2:0 from Gentoo was an ancient C version of
# this program, and khoverlay included the up-to-date 4.3.343 Java
# version under SLOT=java.  Gentoo has now packaged the Java version
# under SLOT=0, and I want to preserve the ebuild for the C version
# since it still runs.  To follow Gentoo, I have imported the SLOT=0
# Java version (bumped to the snapshot already in khoverlay) and the old
# C version is available under SLOT=2.  Please migrate away from
# SLOT=java.
#
# Removal of SLOT=java ebuilds on or after 2024-11-24.
