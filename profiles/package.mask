# New Bugdom and Nanosaur ebuilds have been added that bundle the
# specific version of Pomme that each requires.  Thanks to this, the
# latest versions of Bugdom and Nanosaur are now co-installable.  Please
# upgrade to the latest versions of these packages.  Pomme and Quesa
# ebuilds will be dropped.  You may need to manually uninstall
# dev-games/pomme before upgrading Bugdom or Nanosaur, as new ebuilds
# have a hard block on it.
