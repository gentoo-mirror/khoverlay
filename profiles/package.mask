# Fontmatrix depends on dev-qt/qtwebkit, which has been masked for
# removal in the main Gentoo tree since 2021-08-02.  Fontmatrix is in
# maintenance mode and upstream appears to have no plans to port to
# qtwebengine, so I'm masking it for removal.

# New Bugdom and Nanosaur ebuilds have been added that bundle the
# specific version of Pomme that each requires.  Thanks to this, the
# latest versions of Bugdom and Nanosaur are now co-installable.  Please
# upgrade to the latest versions of these packages.  Pomme and Quesa
# ebuilds will be dropped.  You may need to manually uninstall
# dev-games/pomme before upgrading Bugdom or Nanosaur, as new ebuilds
# have a hard block on it.
