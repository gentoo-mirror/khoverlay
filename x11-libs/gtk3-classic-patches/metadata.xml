  <longdescription>
    gtk3-classic is a set of patches that revert many of the look-and-feel
    changes made during GTK 3's development, restoring it to a more classic
    desktop experience a la GTK 2.

    This package only installs patches into /etc/portage/patches.  It is up to
    the administrator to ensure that x11-libs/gtk+:3 is rebuilt after installing
    the corresponding version of this package.  If both packages are included in
    one emerge run, this package encourages Portage to build x11-libs/gtk+:3
    after, using PDEPEND.

    These ebuilds are slotted so that multiple patch sets can be installed at
    once.  To do this, disable the 'gtk' USE flag on this package so that
    multiple versions of x11-libs/gtk+ aren't pulled into the dependency tree.

    Some select changes, see the homepage for the full list:

    - Client-side decorations are disabled by default on X11.
    - Typeahead is restored in the file chooser, no recursive search.
    - Dialog buttons are again right-aligned.
    - Backdrop CSS state (inactive window shading) is disabled by default.
    - File dialog context popup menu has the traditional look.
    - Scrollbars are visible by default.
